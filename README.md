# Blog
This is my personal blog where I am creating using tutorials from the Odin Project.
I am a college student at the New Mexico State University currently studying computer science. I am now learning Ruby, the Rails framework and how to use Github.
30 minutes later I have created a clone of this repository on my local and computer and will commit this update using terminal.
